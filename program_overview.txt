Working Title: Blue Harvest

INPUT
a system f(x), v so that H(x, t) = f(x) + t*v
a collection of points (w_1, t_1), (w_2, t_2), ..., (w_k, t_k) where:
  0 < t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_k

Everything needs a real and imaginary part
Everything needs to be able to talk to alphaCertified

ALGORITHM
input system and points

test that w_i in the quadratic convergence basin
  use alphaCertified

show that for each segment [t_i, t_{i+1}], a continuous path exists between w_i and w_{i+1}
  returns: 0 for yes, 1 for no
  (don't worry about this just yet; just construct a pseudorandom number generating module)

if yes:
  move on
if no:
  bisect and repeat

CONSIDERATIONS
needs to handle rational and arbitrary-precision floating point
needs to work in parallel
