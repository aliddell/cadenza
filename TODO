= TO-DO =

* write a dummy function to simulate continuity certification (0 or 1)

* write certify_float

* convert floating point stuff to rational to do the calculations

* clean up after polynomial systems in certify_*

* check for fopen/fclose errors in certify_*

* sort t_i from smallest to largest

* actually do the continuity certification

* replace parsing functions with gmp_fscanf

* edit the parsing functions to throw away lines beginning with # (comments)

* check after each malloc for a NULL pointer

* clean up after free with NULL pointers
